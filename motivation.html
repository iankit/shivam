<p>When you love what you have,</br> you have everything you need.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Let your past make you BETTER not BITTER.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It takes some courage to stand up and speak,</br>it takes even more courage to open your mind and listen.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The happiest people don't necessarily have the best of everything,</br> but they make the most of everything.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Anger is an acid that can do more harm, to the vessels,</br> in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.</br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Mark Twain</p>
